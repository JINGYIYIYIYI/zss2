最近忙开题之余偶然看到这本书，花两天时间读了一下，深感就算以后不找教职，这本书读起来也对职业选择受益匪浅。正如标题“Doing Economics”所蕴含的意思，作者写了一本经济学PHD早期career的指南。内容涉及如何撰写paper，如何找funding，如何在会议上Givng-talks，以及如何妥当的寻找合作者和指导学生，这些内容确实非常重要，但是也是学校很少或者会及时教授的。

正如作者所言：

“I wrote this book to demystify the unspoken rules of the economics profession. In so doing, I have tried to shine some light upon the so-called hidden curriculum—those things that are normally “learned but not openly intended” (Martin 1983)—guiding how research economists go about doing their job.”



作者娓娓道来，各章都有很有用的tips，语调平和，建议中肯，没有什么常见的假大空套词。

摘录一段：

“Briefly embrace mediocrity. When trying to write anything, anyone but the most self-delusional of narcissists will typically hear a voice in their head immediately criticizing anything they write once they write it. In a now-famous section of her 1995 book Bird by Bird titled “Shitty First Drafts,” Anne Lamott outlined a very useful strategy to become more productive as a writer, which is as follows: When we write the first draft of anything, we should do so fully expecting that nothing good will come out of it, and knowing that the first draft will be, well, shit. But once you have a first draft, you can improve upon it—no one will ever see how bad your first draft was, and you can just keep polishing it until you have a product you like. The same cannot be said of a draft that never gets written and remains an idea in your mind because you could not briefly embrace mediocrity.”

最后，如今的快餐书太多，在别处看到的一句话也非常有用：

“Any good book for PhD students in economics should be stained with sweat and blood”
